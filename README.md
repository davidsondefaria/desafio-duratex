# Duratex Challenge

The goal of this project is replicate the visual of [DECA blog](https://www.deca.com.br/blog/) using NextJS and Tailwind.

I will be developing this project using the following steps:

- [x] Setup Project
- [ ] Create the Header
- [ ] Create the Cardbox component
- [ ] Create the main page with a list of Cardboxes
- [ ] Create a Footer

> Notes:<br>
> Since there is no requirements about using Javascript or Typescript, I choose Typescript. <br>
> I will not use UI library <br>
> There is no need for backend and every data can be static.

### Disclaimer

I'm just recreating the blog using it's data and visuals for the sake of Duratex job challenge, but I don't own anything about _DECOR_.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
