# Duratex Challenge

The goal of this project is replicate the visual of [DECA blog](https://www.deca.com.br/blog/) using NextJS and Tailwind.

I will be developing this project using the following steps:

- [x] Setup Project
- [x] Create the Header
- [x] Create the Cardbox component
- [x] Create the main page with a list of Cardboxes
- [x] Create a Blog Viewer page
- [ ] Create a Footer

> Notes:<br/>
>
> 1. Since there is no requirements about using Javascript or Typescript, I choose Typescript. <br/>
> 2. I will not use UI library <br/>
> 3. There is no need for backend and every data can be static.
> 4. Beside the default packages to run the project with Typescript, React, NextJS and Tailwind, only 3 packages were added: <br/>
>    4.1 `@contentful/rich-text-react-renderer` to render Rich Text <br/>
>    4.2 `@heroicons/react` to use icons <br/>
>    4.3 `tailwind-merge` to help merge some tailwind classes.
> 5. Is not all pixel perfect, since there is some small differences in some components
> 6. I didn't follow perfect commit semantics
> 7. I created a video with comparing both original and replica side by side

### Disclaimer

I'm just recreating the blog using it's data and visuals for the sake of Duratex job challenge, but I don't own anything about _DECOR_.

## Getting Started
